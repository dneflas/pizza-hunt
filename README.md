## Description

A social media recipe app where users can post their creative spins on pizza, add comments to recipes, and create threads within comments. The backend was created with MongoDB, a document-based NoSQL database, and Mongoose, an Object-Document Mapper, to work with unstructured data. The application has the initial steps to create a progressive web application, by saving data locally when there‚Äôs no internet connection using IndexedDB, a NoSQL client-side storage API in the browser.
